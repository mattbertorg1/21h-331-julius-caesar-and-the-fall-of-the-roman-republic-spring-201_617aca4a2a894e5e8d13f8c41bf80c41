Assessment Criteria
-------------------

*   Is the project viable?
*   Is the project interesting? (Is the question critically minded and sufficiently probing?)
*   Does the proposal reflect a rigorous effort to find relevant scholarly bibliography?
*   Is the proposal well written and generally polished?

The format for the topic proposal and outline is adapted from the [Prospectus Writing Tips](https://www.brown.edu/academics/history/prospectus-writing-tips) of the Department of History at Brown University.

The topic proposal and outline is due during Session 17.
